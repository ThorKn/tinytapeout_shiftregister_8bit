# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.

  title:        "Shiftregister 8 Bit"
  description:  "A simple shiftregister with 8 bit depth, made from D-FlipFlops. Programmable with data and clk, reset. All 8 bits will be mapped to the output."
  how_it_works: "Programm the shiftregister with the data (IN0) and clk (IN1) inputs. With reset enabled, the FlipFlops will be cleared with the next risign edge on the clk. The outputs (OUT0 - OUT7) are driven by the shiftregister bits."
  how_to_test:  "Each rising edge at the clk input pushs a new data bit into the re«µister. Reset happens with the next clk. See the complete state of the register at the 8 outputs."
  external_hw:  "A dipswitch and two button for the inputs. 8 LEDs connected to the outputs."
